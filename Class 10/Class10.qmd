## 1. The PDB Database 

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at: https://www.rcsb.org/

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By Exp method and molecular type. 

```{r}
pdbstats<- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```
The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as characters rather than numeric. 
 I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing "" with the `sub()`  function: 
```{r}
x <-pdbstats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(sub(",","", x)))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()` fucntion.
```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats<- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I can clean up the column names so that they are all lowercase and don't have spaces in them 
```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```
```{r}
library(janitor)
df<-clean_names(pdbstats)
```
Total number of x-ray

```{r}
df
sum(df$x_ray)
```
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```
```{r}
(191374/231029)*100
```
Percent of EM structures:

```{r}
df
sum(df$em)
```


```{r}
(24836/231029)*100
```

Answer: The percent of x-ray is 82.84% and the percent of EM is 10.75%.

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
(sum(df[1:3, "total"]))/(sum(df$total))*100



```

Answer: The portion of structures in the PDB protein structure are 97.9%.

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

## 2. Using Mol* 

The main homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/.
We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4letter pdb code).

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 chains  (A and B)


Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail 

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requries the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")`

```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink")
```


## 4. Predicting functional dynamics 
We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large scale fucntional motions of biomolecules.
```{r}
adk <-read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m<- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecualr motion: 
```{r}
mktrj(m, file= "adk_m7.pdb")
```
